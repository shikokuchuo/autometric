Intense parallel workloads can be difficult to monitor. Packages [`crew.cluster`](https://wlandau.github.io/crew.cluster/), [`clustermq`](https://mschubert.github.io/clustermq/), and [`future.batchtools`](https://future.batchtools.futureverse.org/) distribute hundreds of worker processes over multiple computers. If a worker process exhausts its available memory, it may terminate silently, leaving the underlying problem difficult to detect or troubleshoot. Using the `autometric` package, a worker can proactively monitor itself in a detached POSIX thread. The worker process itself runs normally, and the thread writes to a log every few seconds. If the worker terminates unexpectedly, `autometric` can read and visualize the log file to reveal potential resource-related reasons for the crash.

## Requirements

* A Linux, Mac OS, or Windows operating system.
* POSIX threads. Modern tool chains seem to provide R with POSIX thread support, even on Windows.
* Either POSIX timers or a Windows operating system.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `autometric` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("wlandau/autometric")
```

## Usage

The `log_start()` function in `autometric` starts a non-blocking POSIX thread to write resource usage statistics to a log at periodic intervals. The following example uses the [`callr`](https://callr.r-lib.org/) R package to launch a resource-intensive background process on a Unix-like system. The `autometric` thread prints to standard output, and `callr` directs all its standard output to a temporary text file we define in advance.^[Logging to standard output is useful on clusters like SLURM where workers already redirect standard output to log files, or on the cloud where a service like [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) captures messages instead of directing them to a physical file.] Custom calls to `log_phase_set()` annotate the log data^[See also `log_phase_get()` and `log_phase_reset()`]. 

```{r}
log_file <- tempfile()

process <- callr::r_bg(
  func = function() {
    library(autometric)
    log_phase_set("setup")
    log_start(
      path = "/dev/stdout",
      pids = c(my_worker = Sys.getpid()),
      seconds = 1
    )
    
    log_phase_set("warmup")
    Sys.sleep(3)
    
    print("You can mix printed messages with regular log data.")
    
    print("Defining a function that guzzles CPU power.")
    is_prime <- function(n) {
      if (n <= 1) return(FALSE)
      for (i in seq(2, sqrt(n))) {
        if (n %% i == 0) {
          return(FALSE)
        }
      }
      TRUE
    }
    
    log_phase_set("large object")
    x <- rnorm(1e8)
    
    log_phase_set("heavy cpu")
    lapply(seq_len(1e6), is_prime)
    
    log_phase_set("another object")
    y <- rnorm(1e8)
    
    log_phase_set("more cpu")
    lapply(seq_len(1e6), is_prime)
    
    log_phase_set("third object")
    z <- rnorm(1e8)
    
    log_phase_set("done")
  },
  stdout = log_file
)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
while(process$is_alive()) {
  Sys.sleep(1)
}
```

When we read in the log file, we see messages from both R and the `autometric` thread.

```{r}
writeLines(readLines(log_file))

```

`autometric` knows how to read its log entries even if the log file has other messages. See the documentation of `log_read()` to learn how to interpret the data and customize the measurement units.

```{r}
library(autometric)
log_data <- log_read(log_file)

log_data
```

`autometric` also supports simple visualizations plot performance metrics over time. To avoid depending on many other R packages, `autometric` only uses base plotting functionality. Feel free to create fancier visualizations directly with [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/).

```{r resident}
log_plot(log_data, metric = "resident")
```

```{r cpu}
log_plot(log_data, phase = "more cpu", metric = "cpu")
```

## Attribution

`autometric` heavily leverages fantastic work on the [`ps`](https://ps.r-lib.org/) R package by Jay Loden, Dave Daeschler, Giampaolo Rodola, Gábor Csárdi, and Posit Software, PBC. The source code of [`ps`](https://ps.r-lib.org/) was especially helpful for identifying appropriate system calls to retrieve resource usage statistics. Attribution is given in the `Authors@R` field of the `DESCRIPTION` file, the `LICENSE.note` file at the top level of the package, and in the comments of the C files in `src/`. Please visit <https://github.com/r-lib/ps/blob/main/LICENSE.md> to view the license of [`ps`](https://ps.r-lib.org/). [`ps`](https://ps.r-lib.org/) in turn is based on [`psutil`](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil), whose license is available at <https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/blob/master/LICENSE>.
