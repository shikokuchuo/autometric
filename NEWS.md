# autometric 0.0.5

* Check the validity of the file path in `log_print()` and `log_start()` (#1, @shikokuchuo).
* Document the return value of `log_print()`.
* Make copyright attribution more obvious in the built package:
    1. Move `NOTICE` to `LICENSE.note` so comments on the license and copyright are included in the built package.
    2. Attribute the `ps` and `psutil` copyright holders in the `Authors@R` field of the `DESCRIPTION` file.

# autometric 0.0.4

* Add manual GitHub Actions workflow `rhub.yaml` generated by the `rhub` package.
* Switch to `tinytest`.
* Fix buffer overflow in `pthread_args_init()` (needed to allocate `strlen() + 1` characters instead of just `strlen()` to capture `'\0'`).
* Fix memory leak in `pthread_start()` (free `args` if not creating a thread).

# autometric 0.0.3

* First version
